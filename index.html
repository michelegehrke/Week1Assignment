    <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>After dedicating 27 years to the printing and mailing industry, my role came to an end, prompting a period of reflection about my future direction. 
            Throughout my career, I developed significant experience in programming, mainly focusing on a data field I like to refer to as "programming lite." 
            This aspect of my work was particularly rewarding, as I gained the most satisfaction from tasks centered on data handling and problem-solving.</p>
    <h2>My Goals for this Course</h2>        
            <p>I hope to gain a solid understanding of Web Design, HTML, and CSS from this course. 
                As an older student, I also want to build confidence in my ability to succeed in this class and at school.</p>
